# Caltrac

CalTrac is a personal fitness and nutrition tracker built in **Flutter** with a **Firebase backend**.  
It combines **manual food/drink logging** with **automated WHOOP API data** to help users track calories, macros, and weight over time.  
This project demonstrates skills in **mobile app development, API integration, and backend architecture**.


## Progress Tabs

- Users can view Daily, Weekly, and Monthly summaries. Fetches live whoop data for current day on each load. Ability to navigate to previous, days, weeks, and months. Days with no data will display adequate message.

## Calorie Logging

- Choose between logging calories consumed or extra calories burned (to account for inaccurate whoop readings).
- Entering Calories Consumed: Enter input (item or raw data), along with date -> AI parses natural language input -> Extracts Calories, Protein, Carbs, and Fats -> User confirms data, summary data updates.
- Examples: “10 oz ground beef 93 percent lean” | “Burrito from chipotle with white rice, steak, cheese and guacamole” | “100 cals, 10g protien, 5g carbs, 3g fat"
